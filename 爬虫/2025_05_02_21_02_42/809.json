After more than ten years of hard working, the political science program has developed very quickly. A number of young scholars have been well-established academically and become well-known in China or internationally.

A number of young scholars have been well-established academically and become well-known in China or internationally. The program of public administration, as a rising new program since 1990s, is also developing stably.

In recent years, many of the publication by our professors, such as Zhu Guanglei, Guan Xinping, Wang Chuhui, Gao Yongjiu, and Cheng Tongshun, have received the Humanities and Social Sciences Awards honorably offered by the Ministry of Education, Tianjin and other provinces or ministries.Secondly, Zhou Enlai School of Government has an enthusiastic team of faculty with a favorable structure of age and degree. The average age of the professors is 49, and the average age of doctoral supervisors is 47; in some programs, all the teachers have doctoral degrees. There are a number of young scholars in our programs, and some of these young scholars are establishing themselves or have a bright future in their own research fields.Thirdly, Zhou Enlai School of Government has a wide rang of exchanges with many universities in the United States, Japan, South Korea, Great Britain, Germany, Australia, etc. We have held a number of international or cross-strait academic symposiums on issues of politics and international relations, public administration, and social policy.
