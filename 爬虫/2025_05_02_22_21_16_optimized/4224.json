As of June 2022, there were a total of 8930 alumni (930 full-time graduate students and 8000 cooperative graduate students), spread throughout major cities across the country, contributing to economic and social development. The College of Economic and Social Development Alumni Association was established in November 2014 and is mainly composed of full-time master's and doctoral graduates, as well as part-time master's graduates jointly trained by Nankai University and Flinders University. It provides a platform for alumni to communicate, learn, and innovate through regular events. Since 2022, the Alumni Association has established five liaison departments in Beijing, Tianjin, the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, and Western China. With the support of the Nankai University Alumni Association, we lead alumni to organize various activities to better serve their needs."}
