This paper explores the effect of industry relatedness on new firm survival in China by using a firm-level dataset for the 1999–2008 period. Based on survival models, it contributes to the ongoing debate by pointing out that new firms that are highly related to local industries have a lower failure rate, and the effect of industry relatedness is inflected by regional institutions and firm attributes. Industry relatedness occurs more effectively in the market-oriented regions but less effectively in regions with strong economic and political incentives of local governments. 【文献来源】 Guo Q, Zhu S, He C.
