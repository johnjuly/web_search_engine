This project is one of the earliest master's programs offered in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Relying on the solid foundation of Nankai University's economics and management disciplines and the high-quality resources of Flinders University in the field of international economic and trade relations, we have cultivated a wealth of versatile talents for government, businesses, financial institutions, and other enterprises. By the end of 2022, this programme had been run successfully 33 times, recruiting approximately 4200 students. After graduation, 80% of alumni obtained job promotions in their original workplaces, and many have become leaders in their respective fields."}
