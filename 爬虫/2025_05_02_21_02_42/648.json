In 1927, Mr. Lu Muzhai donated money to build “Mu Zhai” Library, which was destroyed by Japanese bombing in 1937. During the war of resistance against Japanese aggression, Nankai University, Peking University, and Tsinghua University merged to form the National Southwestern Associated University in Kunming and established National Southwest Associated University Library. Later in 1946, Nankai University returned to Tianjin and the Library was rebuilt.      Nankai University Library is comprised of four library buildings: Wenzhong Library、Yifu Library、the Central Library and the Economics Branch Library. The Central Library at the Jinnan Campus was built in 2015, the other three library buildings are all at the Balitai Campus among which the Wenzhong library was built in 1958 and the Yifu Library was built in 1990. The Central Library at the Jinnan campus is the landmark of the new campus. The architectural complex with the Central Library building as its main part won the 2017 China Construction Engineering Luban Prize (National Prime-quality Project). The Central Library offers 36 individual study rooms and 30 seminar rooms equipped with a variety of multiple-function devices, which can be used for academic discussion, project team meetings, and information demonstration or news release, achieving direct interactions beyond distances.    Nankai University Library consists of 11 departments, including the Administration Office, Cultural Construction & Promotion Department Development, Resource Construction Development, Readers’ Service Department(Jinnan Campus), Readers’ Service Department（Yifu Campus）, Multimedia Service Department, Rare Book & Special Collection Department , Information Consultation Department, Subject Service Department, Network Technology Department ,and Logistics & Security Department.
