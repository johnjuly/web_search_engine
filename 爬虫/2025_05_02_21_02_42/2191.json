In view of the exploration ideas for the basic theory of regional economy at home and abroad, we will interpret the relevant research contents of traditional regional economic issues in detail. At the same time, we will pay full attention to the innovation and development of regional economics, as well as the use of new tools. In the course, we will properly introduce some empirical expansion research based on the new economic geography model, and strive to explain in detail the scientific research ideas and research methods that combine theory, demonstration and policy. Through the study of the course, students can form a systematic understanding of the theory and application of regional economics, master the general characteristics of the evolution of China's regional economy, use the frontier methods of regional economics to analyze the current situation and existing problems of China's regional economic development, and lay the foundation for the development of regional economics frontier theory and empirical research.2.

degreeContent introduction: This course plans to teach and discuss the basic theory and application of regional economics for students. In view of the exploration ideas for the basic theory of regional economy at home and abroad, we will interpret the relevant research contents of traditional regional economic issues in detail. At the same time, we will pay full attention to the innovation and development of regional economics, as well as the use of new tools. In the course, we will properly introduce some empirical expansion research based on the new economic geography model, and strive to explain in detail the scientific research ideas and research methods that combine theory, demonstration and policy. Through the study of the course, students can form a systematic understanding of the theory and application of regional economics, master the general characteristics of the evolution of China's regional economy, use the frontier methods of regional economics to analyze the current situation and existing problems of China's regional economic development, and lay the foundation for the development of regional economics frontier theory and empirical research.2. Regional Economic Analysis MethodsCourse type: Master's degreeContent introduction: The purpose of this course is to enable graduate students of regional economics and related majors to master the relevant theories of regional policies and mainstream econometric policy impact assessment methods, and to operate stata for scientific research related to regional policies.1. regional economicsCourse type: Master's degreeContent introduction: This course plans to teach and discuss the basic theory and application of regional economics for students.
